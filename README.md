ðŸ§ª **Getting Started

Prerequisites**

.NET 6 SDK or higher installed

Visual Studio 2022 / VS Code

Docker (for RabbitMQ and optional Mongo/SQL containers)

Connection strings configured in each service appsettings.json

Setup Steps
Clone the repo

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/Vanshika0901/ShopShere
cd Mango_Microservices
Run RabbitMQ via Docker (if not using Azure Service Bus)

bash
Copy
Edit
Open Mango.sln in Visual Studio or via CLI

Run each service project individually

Launch MVC UI (Mango.Web)

This will host the storefront, allowing you to browse products, create account, add to cart, checkout, etc.

API Gateway (Mango.GatewaySolution) should be configured to route to each service endpoint and apply authentication logic.

ðŸ§  **API Usage (via API Gateway)**

POST /api/auth/login â†’ Get JWT token

GET /api/products â†’ List of products (public)

POST /api/cart â†’ Add item (authenticated user)

POST /api/order â†’ Checkout cart

POST /api/payment â†’ Process payment

POST /api/email/send â†’ Send confirmation email
